Hi, this is my personal portfolio!👋

Since I created this portfolio website from scratch without the use of any additional libraries, plug-ins, or templates, it was a huge learning experience for me. My objective was to stretch my boundaries as a web developer and have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 📚

To create a dynamic user experience, the website includes an interactive SVG drawing with mouse-following animations, an automatic text typer, and a gallery that scrolls horizontally. It is hosted on GitHub Pages, and VS Code's GitHub connection allows for a smooth deployment process. Compatibility with several browsers and devices is ensured by the design, which makes particular adaptations for different screen sizes.

With a sticky navigation bar, simple access to sections and professional accounts, and interactive project descriptions that connect to corresponding GitHub repositories, the navigation system is easy to use. Furthermore, a Web3 Forms-powered contact area makes it simple for people to get in touch.

This project demonstrates my devotion to developing a sleek, interesting, and businesslike online presence as well as my passion to learning the core web technologies.🚀👩‍💻
